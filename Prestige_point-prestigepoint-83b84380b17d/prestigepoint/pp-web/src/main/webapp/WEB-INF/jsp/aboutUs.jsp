    <h1 class="heading">About us</h1>
    <p>As said by great ones, "how you start predicts how youâ€™ll lead". The story behind our establishment goes
      back to the wonderful year 2011, a group of talented, young and experienced technocrats came together with a
      single motto to deliver nothing but excellence.</p>
    <p>
      Delivering excellence was a common virtue which was shared by everyone in Prestige Point, the founders, the
      mentors, the staff and the students. Due to our commitment we were able to attract the top-notch Information
      Technology giants since our inception. Our versatility was visible through the organizations that visited us in
      due course of time. From multinational IT vendors like <b>Cognizant, TCS, Infosys, Wipro etc</b>. to the
      specialists like <b>Panasonic, Vedanta, L&T, Volkswagen etc.</b> were associated with us by absorbing our students
      as a part of their employee base.
    </p>
    <p>Prestige Point lays a strong emphasis on training the students conceptually, we believe in doing things
      exceptionally well by going into their roots. We make our students fully equipped by exposing their brains to the
      skillful masters which sculpt them to absorb the critical concepts of technology. We provide our students an
      ambience in which they feel it easy to focus on gaining the most from classroom. A healthy sense of competition is
      prevailed among our students so as to encourage them to take up the challenges.</p>
    <p>We believe in providing our students what is desired most by the software giants, they look out for talents
      with the power to grasp technical know-how with an ability to communicate naturally. In our target placement
      programs we try to inculcate the capabilities to communicate in the most expressive ways every student can.</p>
    <p>We at Prestige Point not only train students, we also help them to pursue their dream in this technical
      world. We provide them the counseling which helps them in targeting their energies in the right direction. We
      believe in giving our students the right kind of guidance, by giving them a chance to speak to the experts
      directly from the industry, by organizing workshops frequently.</p>
    <p>We at Prestige Point take it as our responsibility towards this society, nation and humanity to create such
      individuals which can benefit the people of their surroundings, organization and the country by building solutions
      which can make the life of every human much easier than their earlier days.</p>
